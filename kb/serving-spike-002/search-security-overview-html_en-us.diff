 # Security in [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-network-security-perimeter)
 
-## Security in Azure AI Search
-
 Azure AI Search provides comprehensive security controls across network access, data access, and data protection to meet enterprise requirements. As a solution architect, you should understand three key security domains:
 
-Network traffic patterns and network security: Inbound, outbound, and internal traffic. 
-
-Access control mechanisms: API keys or Microsoft Entra ID with roles. 
-
-Data residency and protection: Encryption in transit, in use with optional confidential computing, and at rest with optional double encryption. 
-
-A search service supports multiple network security topologies, from IP firewall restrictions for basic protection to [private endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview)s for complete network isolation. Optionally, use a network security perimeter to create a logical boundary around your Azure PaaS resources. For enterprise scenarios requiring granular permissions, you can implement document-level access controls. All security features integrate with Azure's compliance framework and support common enterprise patterns like multitenancy and cross-service authentication using managed identities.

 This article details the implementation options for each security layer to help you design appropriate security architectures for development and production environments.
 
-### Network traffic patterns
+# Network traffic patterns
 
 An Azure AI Search service can be hosted in the Azure public cloud, an Azure private cloud, or a sovereign cloud (such as Azure Government). By default, for all cloud hosts, the search service is typically accessed by client applications over public network connections. While that pattern is predominant, it's not the only traffic pattern that you need to care about. Understanding all points of entry as well as outbound traffic is necessary background for securing your development and production environments.
 
 Azure AI Search has three basic network traffic patterns:
 
-Inbound requests made by a user or client to the search service (the predominant pattern) 
-
-Outbound requests issued by the search service to other services on Azure and elsewhere 
-
-Internal service-to-service requests over the secure Microsoft backbone network 
-
-#### Inbound traffic
+- Inbound requests made by a user or client to the search service (the predominant pattern)
+- Outbound requests issued by the search service to other services on Azure and elsewhere
+- Internal service-to-service requests over the secure Microsoft backbone network
+
+# Inbound traffic
 
 Inbound requests that target a search service endpoint include:
 
-Create, read, update, or delete indexes and other objects on the search service 
-
-Load an index with search documents 
-
-Query an index 
-
-Run indexer or skillset jobs 
+- Create, read, update, or delete indexes and other objects on the search service

+- Query an index
+- Run indexer or skillset jobs
 
 The [REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/searchservice/) describe the full range of inbound requests that are handled by a search service.
 
 At a minimum, all inbound requests must be authenticated using either of these options:
 
-[Key-based authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys) (default). Inbound requests provide a valid API key. 
-
-Role-based access control. Authorization is through Microsoft Entra identities and [role assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) on your search service.

+- Role-based access control. Authorization is through Microsoft Entra identities and [role assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) on your search service.
 
 Additionally, you can add network security features to further restrict access to the endpoint. You can create either inbound rules in an IP firewall, or create private endpoints that fully shield your search service from the public internet.
 
-#### Outbound traffic
+# Outbound traffic
 
 Outbound requests can be secured and managed by you. Outbound requests originate from a search service to other applications. These requests are typically made by indexers for text-based and multimodal indexing, custom skills-based AI enrichment, and vectorizations at query time. Outbound requests include both read and write operations.
 
 The following list is a full enumeration of the outbound requests for which you can configure secure connections. A search service makes requests on its own behalf, and on the behalf of an indexer or custom skill.
 
-| Operation | Scenario |
-| - | - |
-| Indexers | Connect to external data sources to retrieve data (read access). For more information, see [Indexer access to content protected by Azure network security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-indexer-securing-resources). |

-| Custom skills | Connect to Azure functions, Azure web apps, or other apps running external code that's hosted off-service. The request for external processing is sent during [skillset execution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-concept-intro). |
-| Indexers and integrated vectorization | Connect to [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/openai/how-to/network-security-perimeter) and a deployed embedding model, or it goes through a custom skill to connect to an embedding model that you provide. The search service sends text to embedding models for vectorization during indexing. |
-| Vectorizers | Connect to Azure OpenAI or other embedding models at query time to [convert user text strings to vectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-how-to-configure-vectorizer) for vector search. |
-| Knowledge bases | Connect to chat completion models for [agentic retrieval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-overview) query planning, and also for formulating answers grounded in search results. If you're implementing a [basic RAG pattern](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview), your query logic calls an external chat completion model for formulating an answer grounded in search results. For this pattern, the connection to the model uses the identity of your client or user. The search service identity isn't used for the connection. In contrast, if you use [knowledge bases](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/agentic-retrieval-how-to-create-knowledge-base) in a RAG retrieval pattern, the outbound request is made by the search service managed identity. |

 Network security protects resources from unauthorized access or attack by applying controls to network traffic. Azure AI Search supports networking features that can be your frontline of defense against unauthorized access.
 
-#### Inbound connection through IP firewalls
+## Inbound connection through IP firewalls
 
 A search service is provisioned with a public endpoint that allows access using a public IP address. To restrict which traffic comes through the public endpoint, create an inbound firewall rule that admits requests from a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses. All client connections must be made through an allowed IP address, or the connection is denied.

The flow starts from an on-premises network, connects via ExpressRoute (ER) Private Peering to an ER Gateway, then to an App Service within a Virtual Network (10.0.0.0/16). Internet access is denied at this stage. The App Service communicates through a firewall to Azure Cognitive Search, which is hosted in its own virtual network. The diagram emphasizes secure, private connectivity and restricted internet access.

 The private endpoint uses an IP address from the virtual network address space for connections to your search service. Network traffic between the client and the search service traverses over the virtual network and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet. A virtual network allows for secure communication among resources, with your on-premises network as well as the Internet.

-#### Network security perimeter
+## Network security perimeter
 
 A network security perimeter is a logical network boundary around your platform-as-a-service (PaaS) resources that are deployed outside of a virtual network. It establishes a perimeter for controlling public network access to resources like Azure AI Search, Azure Storage, and Azure OpenAI. You can grant exceptions through explicit access rules for inbound and outbound traffic. This approach helps prevent data exfiltration while maintaining necessary connectivity for your applications.
 
 Inbound client connections and service-to-service connections occur within the boundary, which simplifies and strengthens your defenses against unauthorized access. It's common in Azure AI Search solutions to use multiple Azure resources. The following resources can all be joined to an [existing network security perimeter](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/create-network-security-perimeter-portal):

-### Authentication
+## Authentication
 
 Once a request is admitted to the search service, it must still undergo authentication and authorization that determines whether the request is permitted. Azure AI Search supports two approaches:
 
-[Microsoft Entra authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-rbac) establishes the caller (and not the request) as the authenticated identity. An Azure role assignment determines authorization. 
-
-Key-based authentication is performed on the request (not the calling app or user) through [an API key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys), where the key is a string composed of randomly generated numbers and letters that prove the request is from a trustworthy source. Keys are required on every request. Submission of a valid key is considered proof the request originates from a trusted entity.

Keys are required on every request. Submission of a valid key is considered proof the request originates from a trusted entity.
 
 Reliance on API key-based authentication means that you should have a plan for regenerating the [admin key](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys) at regular intervals, per Azure security best practices. There are a maximum of two admin keys per search service. For more information about securing and managing API keys, see [Create and manage api-keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-security-api-keys).
 
 Key-based authentication is the default for data plane operations (creating and using objects on the search service).

-### Data residency
+## Data residency
 
 When you set up a search service, you choose a region that determines where customer data is stored and processed. Each region exists within a [geography (Geo)](https://azure.microsoft.com/explore/global-infrastructure/geographies/#overview) that often includes multiple regions (for example, Switzerland is a Geo that contains Switzerland North and Switzerland West). Azure AI Search might replicate your data to another region within the same Geo for durability and high availability. The service won't store or process customer data outside of your specified Geo unless you configure a feature that has a dependency on another Azure resource, and that resource is provisioned in a different region.
 
 Currently, the only external resource that a search service writes to is Azure Storage. The storage account is one that you provide, and it could be in any region. A search service writes to Azure Storage if you use any of the following features:
 
-[enrichment cache](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/enrichment-cache-how-to-configure) 
-
-[debug session](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/cognitive-search-debug-session)

Object names include the names of indexes and index fields, aliases, indexers, data sources, skillsets, synonym maps, resources, containers, and key vault store. Customers shouldn't place any sensitive data in name fields or create applications designed to store sensitive data in these fields.
 
 Telemetry logs are retained for one and a half years. During that period, Microsoft might access and reference object names under the following conditions:
 
-Diagnose an issue, improve a feature, or fix a bug. In this scenario, data access is internal only, with no third-party access. 
-
-During support, this information might be used to provide quick resolution to issues and escalate product team if needed.

 At the storage layer, data encryption is built in for all service-managed content saved to disk, including indexes, synonym maps, and the definitions of indexers, data sources, and skillsets. Service-managed encryption applies to both long-term data storage and temporary data storage.
 
 Optionally, you can add customer-managed keys (CMK) for supplemental encryption of indexed content for double encryption of data at rest. For services created after August 1, 2020, CMK encryption extends to short-term data on temporary disks.

-#### Data at rest
+# Data at rest
 
 For data handled internally by the search service, the following table describes the [data encryption models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/encryption-models). Some features, such as knowledge store, incremental enrichment, and indexer-based indexing, read from or write to data structures in other Azure Services. Services that have a dependency on Azure Storage can use the [encryption features](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-service-encryption) of that technology.

+## Service-managed keys
 
 Service-managed encryption is a Microsoft-internal operation that uses 256-bit AES encryption. It occurs automatically on all indexing, including on incremental updates to indexes that aren't fully encrypted (created before January 2018).
 
 Service-managed encryption applies to all content on long-term and short-term storage.

 CMK support was rolled out in two phases. If you created your search service during the first phase, CMK encryption was restricted to long-term storage and specific regions. Services created in the second phase can use CMK encryption in any region. As part of the second wave rollout, content is CMK-encrypted on both long-term and short-term storage.
 
-The first rollout was on August 1, 2020 and included the following five regions. Search services created in the following regions supported CMK for data disks, but not temporary disks: 
-
-West US 2 
-
-East US 
-
-South Central US 
-
-US Gov Virginia 
-
-US Gov Arizona

-The second rollout on May 13, 2021 added encryption for temporary disks and extended CMK encryption to all supported regions. 
+- The first rollout was on August 1, 2020 and included the following five regions. Search services created in the following regions supported CMK for data disks, but not temporary disks:

+- South Central US
+- US Gov Virginia
+- US Gov Arizona
+- The second rollout on May 13, 2021 added encryption for temporary disks and extended CMK encryption to all supported regions.
 
 If you're using CMK from a service created during the first rollout and you also want CMK encryption over temporary disks, you need to create a new search service in your region of choice and redeploy your content. To determine your service creation date, see [Check your service creation or upgrade date](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-how-to-upgrade#check-your-service-creation-or-upgrade-date).
 
 Enabling CMK encryption will increase index size and degrade query performance. Based on observations to date, you can expect to see an increase of 30-60 percent in query times, although actual performance will vary depending on the index definition and types of queries. Because of the negative performance impact, we recommend that you only enable this feature on indexes that really require it.

-### Logging and monitoring
+## Logging and monitoring
 
 Azure AI Search doesn't log user identities so you can't refer to logs for information about a specific user. However, the service does log create-read-update-delete operations, which you might be able to correlate with other logs to understand the agency of specific actions.
 
 Using alerts and the logging infrastructure in Azure, you can pick up on query volume spikes or other actions that deviate from expected workloads. For more information about setting up logs, see [Collect and analyze log data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/monitor-azure-cognitive-search) and [Monitor query requests](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-monitor-queries).
